# Machine Learning Analysis of NBA Player Injury Risk Factors

## Objective

The objective of this project is to determine the key attributes that have the strongest correlation to NBA players getting injured. Through the use of data mining and machine learning techniques, the aim is to develop key insights that would help players avoid injuries and have a healthy career.

## Process

The analysis will involve analyzing player statistics, position, injury history, and other relevant metrics to answer the following key questions:

1. What are the key attributes that contribute to NBA players being injury-prone?
2. What can be done about these specific key attributes to help players avoid injury?

The dataset used for analysis contains a wide variety of player statistics for NBA players in the 2022-2023 regular season, which is the most recently concluded season, ensuring completeness. Relevant attributes included for each player are:
- Name
- Age
- Position played
- Number of games played that season
- Average minutes played per game

## Dataset Source

The dataset is sourced from the 2022-2023 NBA Player Stats.

## Authentication

The model and dataset will be validated through conventional statistical testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Data Mining

Data mining techniques will be implemented to identify patterns and correlations in the dataset.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to predict and ultimately prevent player injury within specified key attributes.

## Tools

The analysis will be conducted using Google Colab alongside Python libraries, such as Pandas, to analyze and visualize the dataset.

## Anticipated Outcomes

The anticipated outcomes of this project are:
- Identification of attributes that most correlate to NBA player injuries
- Provision of insights and recommendations for injury prevention

## Contributions

This project aims to contribute to:
- Enhancing the health and well-being of players
- Influencing the management of players, league rules and policies, and training regimens to better accommodate the risk of player injury
